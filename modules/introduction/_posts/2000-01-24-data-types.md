title: Data Types and Formats
---

A <h4> data type </h4> is an attribute that specifies the type of data that the object can hold. 

In GIS we use two main data types:
1) Vector  
2) Raster 

<br>

A <h4> data format </h4> is the specific or preferred file extensions for sharing, re-use, and preserving data. 

<br>

> Vector data includes data formats like *shapefiles*. Shapefiles are GIS-specific data formats that are used in both proprietary and open-source software.

> Raster data stores data in a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value.

For today's workshop, we'll only be using vector data., as raster data tends to be larger and slower to work with. If you're interested in using raster data, or have a question on raster data you've already procured, send us an email at (gis@northwestern.edu)[mailto:gis@northwestern.edu] and we can help you out.
