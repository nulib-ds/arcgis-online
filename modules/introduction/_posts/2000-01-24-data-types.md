title: Data Types and Formats
---

A data type is an attribute that specifies the type of data that the object can hold. 

In GIS we use two main data types: 1) Vector and 2) Raster 

A data format is the specific or preferred file extensions for sharing, re-use, and preserving data. 

> Vector data includes 
> ![vector_example](/)

> Raster data includes a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value. 
> ![raster_example](/)
