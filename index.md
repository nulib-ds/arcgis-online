### Goal of this workshop

This workshop is meant to serve as an introduction to esri's ArcGIS Online web-based browser. It's *completely* fine if this is your first time using ArcGIS Online, or GIS in general! We're here to support you.<br>

We'll familiarize you basic GIS concepts, tools, and functions commonly used to build a web map and web mapping application. <br>

Web mapping applications are also referred to as StoryMaps - like this one:
