### Goal of this workshop
This workshop is meant to serve as an introduction to esri's ArcGIS Online web-based browser. It's *completely* fine if this is your first time using ArcGIS Online, or GIS in general! We're here to support you.<br>


We'll familiarize you basic GIS concepts, tools, and functions commonly used to build a web map and web mapping application. <br>


Web mapping applications are colloquially referred to as StoryMaps - like this one:

  <style>.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}</style><div class="embed-container"><iframe width="500" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="An Examination of Chicago's Ballot Drop-Boxes" src="https://northwestern.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=4c5dccabdc5540e590972b00eb755562"></iframe></div>
